# GraphQL API Introduction

## About GraphQL

[GraphQL][gql] is an API standard which expresses data and actions through
_queries_ and _mutations_. It defines a query language which allows clients
to describe exactly the data they need, and to package it into a request.

## Getting the GraphQL Schema

The GraphQL API is located at https://api.rezkit.app/api/graphql.
