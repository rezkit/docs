## Introduction

RezKit TourManager includes an advanced, live product search API as well as a 
suite of web components which can be used to build rich product search
experiences.

This search supports full-text keyword and phrase searching with an advanced and
tuned lexical ranking model. It provides data aggregations and filters for key
holdiay properties such as pricing and departure dates.

The search automatically filters results in realtime based on current inventory
and pricing rules, ensuring the products shown to customers are always live
and up-to-date.

## Search API

The search API is located at `https://tours.api.rezkit.app/holidays/search`.
This is available publicly, does not require authentication credentials, and supports CORS. 
This allows for search API calls to be made directly from the browser for a live user experience.

All search options are specified via **URL Query Parameters**.
[Some filter rules are applied by default](#default-rules)

The following parameters are supported

| Parameter Name | Example | Description |
|:--------------:|:--------------|:------------|
| `k` | rezkit | **(required)** Organization search key. This is required on all searches to identify your organization for search. |
| `ccy` | USD  | **(required)** ISO Currency code. All searches require a currency code and return only pricing in that currency. |

## Available Search Options

### Sorting Results

Results can be sorted based on the following, the `s[]` parameter can be repeated
to set how to break tied results.
Result sort options are specified as a field name, followed by a pipe (`|`) and
then either `ASC` or `DESC` to set the sort direction.

:::tip Sorting Full-Text Searches
When performing full-text searches (using the `q` parameter) it is **highly**
recommended to always sort using `_score|DESC`. This is applied by default, to ensure
that the most relevant results are returned first.
:::

The following fields are available:

* `name` -- Holiday Name (Lexical sorting)
* `code` -- Holiday Code (Lexical sorting)
* `price` -- Prices (numeric sorting)
* `date` -- Departure _start_ dates (chronological sorting)
* `_score` -- Text-search relevance sorting

:::warning Date & Price Sorting
It is not possible to sort results by *both* `date` *and* `price`.
Only one of these two options may be specified.
:::


### Filtering on Price

Prices are specified using the `pf` and `pt` paramters, both of which are optional.
For a price to be included as a result it must have a value between `pf` and `pt`, inclusive.
Any price returned by the filter must also match the following rules:

1. It is in the currency specified by `ccy`
2. The price is marked as "On Sale"
3. The _element option_ of the price must be marked as a "Leading Price"
4. The _element_ of the price must be marked as a "Package Element"
5. The price must be for an available departure in the future.

Where a holiday or departure has mutiple leading prices, a match will be found if at least one
of the values matches.

### Filtering on Dates

Dates are specified using the `df` and `dt` paramters and supports filtering
using _RFC3339 Nano_ formatted date-times, supporting up to microsecond precision.
The time part is optional and will default to midnight UTC if omitted.

When specified the filters apply different rules depending on the type of departure.

For fixed departures, the whole departure must be _within_ the specified dates.

:::tip Example
  A search with the options `df=2025-10-03&dt=2025-10-28` would match only fixed
  departures which depart _on or after_ **3rd October 2025**, and return 
  _on or before_ **28th October 2025**.
:::

### Filtering on Categories
Categories are specified in the filters using parameters beginning with `c`,
followed by a digit. The represents how many levels are above that category.

Top-level categories are specified by the `c0` parameter. Direct children of
these categories are specified by the `c1` parameter, and so on up to `c3`.

When specifying a category, it is specified using the names of all its
ancestors, and itself, separated by a tilde (`~`).

For example the "Trekking and Walking" category, a child of the "Activity"
category would be specified as: `c1[]=Activity~Trekking+and+Walking`.
The name must be exactly as in Tour Manager, with special characters
URL-escaped.

The `cX` parameter can be repeated any number of times to add addional filter
values, the behaviour of which can be altered by the [search join mode](#search-join-modes).

### Filtering on Locations

Locations are specified in filters using their name as well as their category name.
For example, a location called "Bulgaria" with the category of "Country" would
be specified as: `l[Country][]=Bulgaria`

The name of the location and its category must match exactly the values in Tour Manager.
The `l` parameters can be repeated any number of times to add additional filters,
the behaviour of which can be altered by the [search join mode](#search-join-modes).

### Filtering on [Custom Fields](./custom-fields)

Custom fields can be filtered using the `fh` and `fd` parameters.
The `fh` parameter controls filtering on _holiday_ custom fields,
and the `fd` parameter controls filtering on the _departure_ custom fields.

:::warning Matching
Custom fields support filtering for an exact match against a specific
value **only**, checking that the field is present on the result _and_ has the exact
same value as specified by the search filter.
:::

### Search Join Modes

The search API supports two different join modes. This controls how the various
filter options are combined to get a set of results.
These are set using the `j` parameter which can have either the value `a` for
adjoined, or `d` for disjointed.
If not specified the `j` parameter defaults to `a`.
This option primarily controls how categories and locations are filtered.

#### Adjoined Mode
In adjoined mode, filter options are combined using an "and" clause.
This means that for a result to match, it must have *all* the specified values.
Thus, adding more filter options to your search will narrow down the results returned.

This applies within a filter option, such as `c0` or `l[Country]`, with different
filters always being combined using an "and" clause.

#### Disjointed Mode
In disjointed mode, filter options are combined using an "or" clause.
This means that for a result to match, it msut contain *at least one* of the specified values.

This applies within a filter option, such as `c0` or `l[Country]`, with different
filters always being combined using an "and" clause.

### Default rules

The following rules are applied to holiday searches by default and cannot be
disabled:

* Holidays, Versions, and Departures **must** all be published.
* Holidays **must** be marked as "visible in search."
* Departures **must** be in the future
* Prices **must** be "On Sale"
