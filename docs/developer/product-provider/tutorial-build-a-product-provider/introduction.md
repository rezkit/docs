# Tutorial Introduction

RezKit books products that it doesn't own using **Product Providers**.
Providers handle information and booking of travel products via a standardized interface.

To add your own products to the RezKit marketplace, you'll need to expose
those products with your own Product Provider.

The source code for the finished project can be found [on Github][repo]

:::tip Examples

We'll be using JavaScript in our example, but Product Providers can be
written in any language.
