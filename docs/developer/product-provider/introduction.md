# Introduction

RezKit interacts with external products though services which have a unified interface.
These services are known as _Product Providers_.

_Product Providers_ are HTTP services with standardized data formats, authentication mechanisms
and operation.
A provider can implement either some or all of the available features and signals to RezKit
which features are supported by using a [Service Descriptor][service-descriptor]

## Building a Provider

The best way to get started with building a product provider is to follow along with our
[tutorial](./tutorial-build-a-product-provider/introduction)
