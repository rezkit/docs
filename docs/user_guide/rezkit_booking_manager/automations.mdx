We can setup automated tasks in RezKit to perform actions on bookings if particular conditions are true. Automations are widelty used for sending customer messages such as balance reminder emails, feedback emails or internal notifications. Automations can also be used to update data, such as tagging bookings, if particular conditions are true.

Tasks can be run on a schedule or can be triggered by webhooks when specific events happen, such as booking creation.
