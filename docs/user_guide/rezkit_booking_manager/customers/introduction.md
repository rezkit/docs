Customers
=========

In RezKit simple Customers records can be used to link Bookings together so you have a view of repeat bookers and so that the Customer can see all of their bookings in their account.

## DeDuping Customers
RezKit has a powerful de-duping tool to help you keep your data clean.

when viewing a Customer or a Booking in RezKit, a duplicate icon will be shown if there are suspected duplicates. RezKit automatically identifies potential duplicate customers by looking for matches on a combination of name, email address, address and other factors. If duplicates are identified you can easily merge the customer records.

## Merging Duplicate Customers
when you merge one customer into another, the mergeed customers bookings, passenger records and notes are automatically moved to the customer you choose to keep. The merged customer is then removed.
