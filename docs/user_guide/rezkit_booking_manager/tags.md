Tags
=====

Tags can be used in many areas of RezKit and are configurable so you can use them as you wish. You can create different Tags and choose a colour up in the Settings.

Tags can be output on reports, used in automations and are displayed through out RezKit and can be used to draw attention.

For example, you could tag bookings as 'Must Contact'. You will see this tag at the top of the booking and you can search filter the bookings list for all bookings with this tag.
