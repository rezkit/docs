RezKit is integrated with over 30 different payment processors out-of-the-box and you can change payment processors yourself in the settings. Popular payment processors include Stripe, Trust Payments, Go Cardless, ecommpay, checkout.com, Opayo, Global Payments and more. Depending on your payment processor you can also take payments via Paypal, Googlepay and Applepay.

Within a booking you can view a summary of all transactions, add new transactions, refund transactions, add cash, cheque or bank transfer transactions and also transfer funds between bookings.

Bookings can be created in any currency and transactions can be taken in the appropiate currency (depending on your payment processor and merchant account settings).
