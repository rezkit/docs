Bookings have a status to provide you with a general view of the state of a booking. This is seperate from the [Product Reservation Status](reservations#product-reservation-status) where each Product Reservation can have its own status. 

## Booking Status

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pending | This is usually a new booking or a booking you are still putting together. In most cases you will set a booking to confirmed once you have added Passengers and Product Reservations, confirmed the product reservations and taken a payment or deposit. The Pending state showas that you are still working on the booking. New bookings made online will usually go straight to confirmed status if the Products are all available and the customers payment has been processed sucessfully. |
| Confirmed | This is usually a confirmed and finalised booking. All the Products are available and so the Product Reservations are confirmed, a payment or deposit has been taken and you have collected all the information you need from the customer to confirm the booking. |
| Hold | You can use this status as you wish to mark a booking as 'On Hold' if perhaps you need to make changes to the booking.  |
| Cancelled | If this customer is no longer travelling and then the booking can be marked as cancelled. Cancelled bookings will be excluded from reports such as manifests.  |
| Archived | Use this status for bookiings that you want to exclude from reports of cancelled bookings. |
