Passengers
==========

These are the people travelling on the booking. In the Passengers section of a booking you can view and update information specific to each passenger. You can update their names, contact information and travel specific information such as passport details.

## Custom Passenger Information
RezKit enables you to collect custom passenger information depending on the Products they have booked. You can manage which information is required for your products in RezKit Product Manager. If information is required, then fields for this information will be shown with each Passenger. For example, you may need to collect someones height because they are taking part on a cycling trip and you need to provide an appropiate sized bike. RezKit can show a height field, with an explaination of why you need this information. You can even configure this field to be a number field and give it a description to specify that the information should be provided in centremetres.

### Custom Passenger Field Types
You can setup Custom Passenger Fields in the following formats:
* Telephone number
* Single line text
* Multi-line text
* Number fields
* Checkboxes
* Select lists (choose one or choose many)

You can set charachter limits, minimum and maximum values and more. You can group fields with headings add add text explainations (with translations to any language).

### Custom Passenger Field Due Dates
You can set Customer Passenger Fields as Required imediately, in which case the information must be provided by the customer when they make the booking.

Or you can set a due date (relative to departure) and the customer will be notified that the information is required in their Customer Account, when the due date approaches. If a customer books after the due date for a peice of Custom Passenger Information, then this information will be collected when they book.

When viewing bookings, Warnings will be shown to you in RezKit if Passenger Information is overdue.

Passengers who have had Product Reservations cannot be deleted from a booking to ensure you have a permenent record of any cancellations.

## Linking Passengers to Customers
