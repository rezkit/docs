# Anatomy Of A Holiday
_Holidays_ are the centreepeice of RezKit Product Manager. A 'holiday' could be any kind of travel package from a group trekking tour to a single centre accommodation package, a ski holiday, an adventure tour, a cultural tour, a private tour or a self guided tour.

RezKit has features that make it easy and logical to manage content regardless of the type of holiday you want to manage. Features such as _content items_ and _custom fields_ can be seen through RezKit Product Manager.

Not all features have to be used for all types of holiday.

Within a holiday you can manage descriptions, SEO information, other content items, images, custom fields, categories, locations, versions, itineraries, departures (or date ranges) and prices (in any currency).

## Content Items
Content Items can be given titles and a category and used on a single holiday or shared across multiple holidays.
This makes it easy to keep your content up to date.
It also makes it easy for web developers to target content item of a particular category, and output those content items where they need to on your web pages.

## Custom Fields
Custom Fields can be used throughout RezKit including on Holidays.
You can setup different types of Custom Fields to ensure content is always loaded in the correct format and therefore is output consistently on your website.

## Images
RezKit Product Manager has a powerful image management tool.
You can bulk upload high res images, tag images, search the image library and link images to multiple holidays or other areas of RezKit Product Manager.
You can order the images on a holiday, set image focal points and view all the places an image is used.
Images are served through global CDN to keep your website running fast, and are automatically cropped and resized also to help performance.

## Categories
Categories can be customised for your product / holidays. 
Categories can be used as filters within your  website search page.
they can also be targetted by web developers to affect the style, layout or behaviour of of your web pages.

I.e. You could create a category for 'Trip Grade' with sub categories of easy, moderate and hard. This could be a filter in your search page but also could display different icons on your trip pages to your customers.

## Locations
Like categories, Locations can be customsed for your products and can be used in our website search page and to display information on your trip pages.

## Versions
A holiday can have many versions. A version can have an itinerary and many Departures (or date ranges).

You could create a version for the next season, perhaps because you have changed the itinerary from one year to the next. Or you could create a Holiday version for a special departure of a trip, perhaps to visit an event or a festival that only occurs during one or a few of your departures.

If the above do not apply then you simply create a single version for each holiday.

### Itineraries
Day by day itineraries can be created within your holiday versions. 
You can manage each day of the itinerary or you can create entries that cover multiple days.
Itinerary entries can contain descriptions, content, custom fields and can be linked to accommodation.

### Maps
RezKit has a map editor where you can draw maps that can be displayed on your website as Google maps or Mapbox maps.

### Locations
A holiday or a holiday version can be linked to a location.

### Custom Fields 
Custom Fields can be used throughout RezKit including on Holiday Versions.
You can setup different types of Custom Fields to ensure content is always loaded in the correct format and therefore is output consistently on your website.

### Elements & Price Options
RezKit has a powerful and flexible feature for managing availability and prices in different ways.
You could use this to create basic 'tour spaces' or you could create different price structures for more complicated products.
i.e. Adult and child prices, prices for different occupancies and group sizes, prices with or without flights, or prices for different cabin types of a cruise.

## Departures & Prices
Departures (or date ranges) belong to both a holiday and a version.
So you could create a holiday with different versions because the itinerary changes for the 2026 season, departures in the 2026 season can be linked to the appropiate version.
Departures is where you manage your prices. Prices can be in any currency and they are linked to Elements and Price Options so you can manage prices for different price types (e.g. adult, child, with flights, without flights, different package levels ect).
You can manage deposits on a departure basis if you wish and you can also link custom fields or categories to departures.
