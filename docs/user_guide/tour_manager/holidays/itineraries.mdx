RezKit has a powerful itinerary builder. You can manage each day of your itinerary individually adding descriptions, images, content items and custom fields to each itinerary day. Or you can create itinerary entries that cover a number of days of your itinerary.

Custom fields can be used to link specific information to your itinerary days such as, type of accommodation, distance travelled, meals included, 

You can create different itineratries for different versions of a holiday, perhaps because you are changing the itinerary for the next seasons or perhaps you are running a one off departure with a different itinerary.
