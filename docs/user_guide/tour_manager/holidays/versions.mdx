Versions is a powerful way to manage changes or variants in your tours, holidays or packages.

A holiday can have many versions. A version can have an itinerary and many Departures (or date ranges).

You could create a version for the next season, perhaps because you have changed the itinerary from one year to the next. Or you could create a Holiday version for a special departure of a trip, perhaps to visit an event or a festival that only occurs during one or a few of your departures.
