Content Items are a flexible tool that enables you to manage text content for a wide variety of different types of holiday without boggind RezKit down with specific text fields.

Shared Content Items makes it easy to maintain your content because a Content Item can be linked to several Holidays or other areas of RezKit Product Manager. When you update a shared Content Item, it is updated for all the holidays it is linked to.

Content Items can be linked to Categories and grouped by Categories and they can be shared across holidays.

It is important to be well organised in terms of how you categories and organise your content items and it is advisable to work with your website developers and designers to establish what Content Item Categories are required.

## Content Item Usage

You can create Content Items in the following areas of RezKit:

* Holidays
* Locations
* Accommodation
* Extras

## Understanding Content Item Categories (and How Web Developers Will Use Them)

On your web pages your web developers can write code to grab content items by their category name.

For example, you could operate history tours and the design of the webpage for each of your tours could include a box near the top of the page that lists the highlights of each tour.

You would create a Content Item Category called 'Highlights'.
You would add a Highlights Content Item to each of your tours in RezKit Product Manager.
Your web developers would write code to get the Highlights Content Item and output it in the right format and in the right place.

Or, you could be a beack holiday operator and on the web page for each of your beach holidays you want to have a section titlisting all the available activites for kids.

You would create a Content Item Category called 'kids activities'.
You would add several Content Items to each of your Holidays, one for each available Activity.
The Content Items would contain a title, a description and an image.
Your web developers would write code to get the 'Kids activities' content items, and output them all on your web pages.

You could even share some of the Content Items and link them to all the beach holidays based at this resort.

## Shared Content Items
All Content Items can be shared. Within a Holiday you can add a new Content Item but you can also search the global list of Content Items to link an existing Content Item to a Holiday (or whichever item you are editing).

## Content Item Usage

Within a Content Items you can see a list of all the Holidays, Accommodation, Locations or Extras that the Content Item is linked to.

## Images On Content Items
You can link Images to Content items if uou wish. Your web developers can then use these images to create nice layouts on your website combining the copy with images. 

## Text Content in Content Items
Content Items have a rich text editor so you can enter plain text, multiple paragraphs, bullet points, numbered lists, bold, italic, underlined text, links, quote marks and headings.

Again, it is imprtant to work with your web develoeprs and web designers and ensure you are entering content consistently and in alignment with your websites design to ensure a consistent apperance through the site.
