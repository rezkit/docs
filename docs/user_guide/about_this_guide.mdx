RezKit is a modern user interface and is fairly intuative and simple to use. We aim for most functionality to be self explanatory, of course there are some areas of RezKit that are more complicated than others.

This user guide aims to inform you as to what is possible within RezKit and guide you as to where in RezKit things can be done.
